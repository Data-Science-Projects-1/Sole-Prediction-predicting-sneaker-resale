Sole Prediction: Predicting the resale price of sneakers

In recent years, the sneaker resale market has exploded, driven by limited releases, celebrity endorsements, and cultural trends. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the resale prices of sneakers based on various factors such as brand, model, release date, colorway, etc. 

Our goal for this project would be to capture as much of an end to end machine learning project as possible, starting collecting data from sneaker resale platforms (e.g., StockX, GOAT), cleaning and processing the data, doing some exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, implementing various machine learning algorithms we learn in the boot camp to predict resale price, and if possible, develop a user-friendly web application that allows users to input sneaker attributes and receive a resale price prediction, along with visual insights into the market.

Our targeted stakeholders for this project includes sneaker enthusiasts, collectors, resellers, and e-commerce platforms interested in optimizing pricing strategies and understanding market dynamics.
